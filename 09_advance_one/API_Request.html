<!--
// 🌐 API stands for **Application Programming Interface**
// It acts as a **communication bridge** between two systems — often frontend and backend.
//
// Think of it as a *messenger* or *medium* that allows different software applications to talk to each other.
//
// 📱 Examples:
// - Your frontend (React, HTML, etc.) can talk to your own backend using an API.
// - Or, your frontend can talk to a third-party service (like weather API, payment gateway, etc.).
// - Your backend can even call another backend's API.
//
// APIs make it possible to:
// ✅ Send data
// ✅ Request data
// ✅ Update or delete data
//
// 🧠 In short: API is like a **language** or **agreement** that two systems follow so they can understand each other.
// It's how software components communicate — securely, reliably, and efficiently.


// 🌍 Some well-known public APIs include:
//
// 1. GitHub Users API:
//    https://api.github.com/users/username
//    👉 This returns detailed information about a GitHub user.
//    👉 The response is in JSON format — basically a big object containing keys like:
//       - name
//       - email
//       - location
//       - followers
//
//    You can access specific properties in JavaScript using dot notation:
//    Example: user.name, user.email, etc.
//
// 2. Random User API:
//    https://randomuser.me/
//    👉 This returns randomly generated user data — good for testing or learning.
//    👉 You’ll get a nested JSON object with user info like gender, name, location, picture, etc.
//
// 📦 JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the most common format used for API responses.
// It’s just structured data — like an object with key-value pairs (and sometimes nested objects or arrays).
//
// 🧰 To **read and understand JSON data** easily:
// Use tools like: https://jsonformatter.org or https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com
//
// 👉 Steps:
// - Paste your raw JSON data into the site.
// - Click "Format" or "Beautify".
// - You can view the data in different styles: raw text, code view, form, or tree.
//
// ✅ The **Tree View** is the easiest to explore complex nested data — 
it lets you expand/collapse objects and see what’s inside.

XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects are used to interact with servers. 
You can retrieve data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh. 
This enables a Web page to update just part of a page without disrupting what the user is doing.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/AJAX ---- Read about this

XMLHttpRequest: readyState property:
XMLHttpRequest.readyState values:
0 - UNSENT:           Client has been created. open() not called yet.
1 - OPENED:           open() has been called.
2 - HEADERS_RECEIVED: send() has been called, and headers and status are available.
3 - LOADING:          Downloading; responseText holds partial data.
4 - DONE:             The operation is complete.

    // XMLHttpRequest() is a built-in JavaScript object available in browsers.
    // It is used for asynchronous communication with a server (commonly known as AJAX).
    // With this, you can "send" and "receive" data without reloading the page.
    // To use it, you need to create a new object using the "new" keyword:
    //    let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

    // This object handles a fresh request — for every new request, a new object is used.

    // Although there are modern alternatives available today (like fetch() and Axios),
    // XMLHttpRequest is still widely supported and commonly used, especially in legacy systems.

    const requesUrl = 'https://api.github.com/users/rishabhx01'
    const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open('GET', requesUrl)                  // The open() method doesn't call itself automatically
    // console.log(xhr.readyState);                // you can continuously track this

    // For Continuously tracking
    xhr.onreadystatechange = function(){
        console.log(xhr.readyState);
        if (xhr.readyState === 4) {
           // const data = this.responseText
           const data = JSON.parse(this.responseText)
           // console.log(this.responseText);         // whenever we talk about current context we use "this"
           console.log(data);                 
           console.log(data.following);              // we are extracting data from objects using dot(.)  --> output - undefined
           console.log(typeof data);                 // Most of the time the response come from url is in the form of string
           console.log(data.email);

           // convert string into Number
           // const data = this.responseText --> const data = JSON.parse(this.responseText)

           // Assignment
           // Extract photo from this object and followers and make a card .. click on button ...
           // where you can see photo and followers.
           // console.log(avatar_url);

        }
    }
    xhr.send()
    // open() just prepares the request. It's like dialing a number — the call hasn't started until you press "call" (i.e., send()).

<!--
// 🔍 console and document are NOT part of core JavaScript.
// Core JavaScript (as defined by ECMAScript) is just the language specification — it doesn't include browser-specific features.
//
// 🛠 console.log is a debugging tool provided by the environment (like a browser or Node.js).
// It's not part of the language itself — 
// that's why you don't get console.log in isolated JS environments (like a JS engine without a host).
//
// For example: Browsers (like Chrome, Firefox) inject 'console' and 'document' objects.
// Similarly, Node.js provides 'console', 'require', 'process', etc.
//
// 📄 The 'document' object (and methods like document.getElementById) are provided by the browser's DOM API —
// which is also not part of JavaScript itself. It's part of the web platform (environment).
//
// 💡 JavaScript runs inside environments like:
//    - Browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
//    - Node.js (server-side)
//
// 🧠 Node.js is an implementation of the V8 JavaScript engine — the same engine that runs in Chrome.
// V8 is developed by Google, and the full source code is open-source and written in C++:
// 👉 https://github.com/v8
// 👉 Source code lives here: https://github.com/v8/v8/tree/main/src
//
// 🧵 So essentially, JavaScript is a **high-level wrapper** built over low-level code written in C++.
// JS engines like V8 compile and optimize your JavaScript to native machine code using C++ under the hood.
